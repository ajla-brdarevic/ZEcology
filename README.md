# ZEcology

School project from the subject Software analysis and design. The idea of the project is to create a mobile application that will encourage the citizens of our city to properly recycle waste. Agile methods were used to create the project, as well as all the necessary documentation for starting a software project. In addition, we made UML diagrams using Visual Paradigm.
